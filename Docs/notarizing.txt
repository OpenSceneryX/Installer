Notarizing with Apple
=====================

From Mojave onwards, Gatekeeper will soon start to require that an application is Notirized with Apple.  As we have a .dmg package, the notarization is done on the DMG using the following command from the directory where OpenSceneryX-Installer.dmg is located:

$ xcrun altool --type osx --notarize-app --file OpenSceneryX-Installer.dmg --primary-bundle-id com.aussi.opensceneryx.installer --username <username> -itc_provider <team_id>

This will request a password, which is an app-specific password generated here: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage (stored in Keychain)
The <username> is the email address for the Apple Develor ID
The iTunesConnect <team_id> needs to be passed in as the itc_provider, this can be found here: https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership/
The command returns a request UUID

To check the status of a notarization:

$ xcrun altool --notarization-info <request_uuid> -u <username> -p 

Once notarization is complete, staple the ticket to the dmg:

$ xcrun stapler staple -v OpenSceneryX-Installer.dmg

And to verify an installed application after download:

$ spctl -a -v /Applications/OpenSceneryX-Installer.dmg
