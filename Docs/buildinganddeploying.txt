Building and Deploying the Installer
====================================

o The Windows version of the installer needs the zlib1 DLL to be included at the same level as the executable.  This is done by a Windows build step, but the DLL must be downloaded and present at Libraries/zlib1-64/zlib1.dll

o To sign the Windows app, copy it to a Windows machine as well as the .p12 certificate and sign using the following command:

> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\signtool.exe" sign /v /f "Austin Goudge.pfx" /p <certificate-password> /d "OpenSceneryX Installer" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "OpenSceneryX Installer.exe"

o The Mac app is signed automatically by the build process, but some machines it still claims it's from an unidentified developer.
